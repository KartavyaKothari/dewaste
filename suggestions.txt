1. Other than disposal methods and locations of disposal centres, I would also like to have a link to the grievance cell of Municipal corporation or local police station, so that complaints can be lodged by a person if he/she notices any e-garbage is dumped in public /common areas.
2. (Partial Suggestion) Also feature could if you could help the users get directly connected to E-commerce sites where they can replace their electronic item for a better value. This could be done for mobile phones and laptops of the newer generation. The above would be better for the older generation electronics and the long-lasting ones such as modems and cables.
3. Be able to share/show off my e-waste amount (not in kg) in terms of CO2 saved, energy saved etc. Each transaction with the bhangarwala should send me an 'inverse bill': item, weight, value.
4. Categorisation of E Waste, Level of e waste ( like is it useful in some way or not ) Someone may need some parts
